Hanna Larsson,"Don’t spend another year doing the same shit.

Waiting.
Postponing.
Telling yourself you’ll do it later.

Later rarely comes.

Later turns into another year in a job you hate.
Another year talking about starting a business.
Another year being good at what you do and invisible because of it.

""Let the results speak for themselves""

Being quiet gets you nowhere.

Working hard in silence doesn't get you recognition.
It gets you more work.

If you want change, you have to speak up.

You have to promote yourself.
You have to be intentional about your personal brand.

IRL and online.

This is not optional anymore.

The people who move ahead are rarely the best.

They are the ones who show up, share what they know, and stop waiting for permission.

If something feels off in your career, trust that signal.

If you want more, ACT like it.

Start now.

STEPHEN MUIKIA,"📌 My name is Steve Muikia, the original innovator behind PesaLink. I developed # Pesalink which was later snatched from me by Kenya Bankers Association 

Most of you know the long, painful journey I have been on pursuing #PesaLinkJustice.

Here is the link to the whole #PesalinkTheft ordeal (https://lnkd.in/dWqJVvH4)

The fight drained me financially.
My other innovations have stalled due to a serious liquidity crunch.

I’ve reached a point where silence is no longer an option.

I never thought I’d reach a point of posting this, but I can’t keep quiet anymore.

If anyone can bail me out, support, or connect me to an opportunity, I would be grateful.
Even the hustles I’ve tried on the ground have refused to work.

Joy Omonigho,"Consistency Builds Legacies, Not Noise

On his last day after 36 years of teaching, students lined the hallway in silence—applauding, not with words, but with respect. No grand ceremony. No loud announcements. Just a powerful moment that spoke volumes.

This is a powerful lesson for the business environment.

True impact isn’t built overnight, and it’s not measured only by profits, titles, or viral wins. It’s built through years of showing up, doing the work with integrity, leading with patience, and treating people right—even when no one is watching.

In business, just like in teaching, your daily discipline becomes your reputation. Your consistency becomes your brand. And your character determines the kind of legacy you leave behind.

When you invest genuinely in people—clients, teams, partners—you may not see immediate applause. But one day, the results will stand quietly and powerfully in your favor.

That is how lasting influence is earned.

Nondumiso Xulu,"SCAM ALERT⚠️

Please Be Careful!
I recently received a connection request from a lady who claimed to be a Training Consultant for IT & Management certifications and said she could help people pass any of the listed certificate from the screenshot, with payment only after passing. She messaged me immediately after I accepted the request and asked if I was looking for any certificate.

Out of curiosity I asked how much it would cost, but I didn't continue the conversation or share any personal details. However, she kept messaging me and at some point she or someone she works with managed to find my contact number, which really made me uncomfortable since I never shared it.😔
I'm not sure how the whole scam works but it felt fishy from the start. Please be cautious with such offers! 

I just wanted to put this out there in case it helps someone else 🤝",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nondumiso-xulu-566190346_scam-alert-please-be-careful-i-recently-activity-7411762662675582976-B56Y,50,15,7,2025-12-30 17:59:19,Negative

Mercy Gbewa,"Success has a strange pattern most people miss.
The more you chase it for yourself, the harder it feels to reach.

But when you shift your focus, something changes.

Helping others win does not slow you down.
It pulls you forward.

Here’s why ↓

→ When you support others, you build trust
→ Trust creates strong relationships
→ Relationships open doors effort alone never will

People remember who helped them grow.
They remember who shared knowledge.
They remember who showed up without keeping score.

Success rarely comes from stepping on others.
It compounds when you lift people up.

If you want more opportunities,
be useful.

If you want influence,
be generous.

Success has a way of finding those
who help others find theirs first.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mercy-gbewa-514684123_success-has-a-strange-pattern-most-people-activity-7411808751042715648-QuOV,5,1,0,2025-12-30 17:59:19,Positive
Emmanuella Okoro,"I've noticed something in the last few days.

A lot of us are carrying this quiet anxiety into the new year. Not because we don't want change, but because we know something has to change.

And that realization? It can feel pretty unsettling.

We pause. We think. We plan. We wait for clarity, for courage, for the ""right time.""

And before we realize it, we're stuck in our heads, imagining a future we haven't stepped into yet.

Here's what I've learned: most of the time, the problem isn't that we don't know what to do. It's that starting feels uncomfortable.

Before you rush into setting goals for 2026, I want to invite you to do something simple but powerful.

Observe yourself.

Not with judgment. Not with pressure. Just with honesty.

In Issue #4, I'm talking about why that quiet anxiety shows up, what it's really asking of us, and how to step into this year with intention instead of pressure.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emmanuella-okoro-86a920234_ive-noticed-something-in-the-last-few-days-activity-7412341860913991680-bLk8,4,2,0,2026-01-01 5:59:19,Neutral
Dhir Dudani,"A client reported that he was having issues with his laptop.  The laptop did not pick up any WiFi networks at all and was starting to become slow. 
This laptop was running on 4gb RAM  with windows 11 pro. 
We decided that Windows 10 would run way smoother and set up office for him. 

All of this value for only R700😊
