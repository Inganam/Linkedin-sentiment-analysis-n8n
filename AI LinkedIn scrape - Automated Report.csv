"Don’t spend another year doing the same shit.

Waiting.
Postponing.
Telling yourself you’ll do it later.

Later rarely comes.

Later turns into another year in a job you hate.
Another year talking about starting a business.
Another year being good at what you do and invisible because of it.

""Let the results speak for themselves""

Being quiet gets you nowhere.

Working hard in silence doesn't get you recognition.
It gets you more work.

If you want change, you have to speak up.

You have to promote yourself.
You have to be intentional about your personal brand.

IRL and online.

This is not optional anymore.

The people who move ahead are rarely the best.

They are the ones who show up, share what they know, and stop waiting for permission.

If something feels off in your career, trust that signal.

If you want more, ACT like it.

Start now.

"📌 My name is Steve Muikia, the original innovator behind PesaLink. I developed # Pesalink which was later snatched from me by Kenya Bankers Association 

Most of you know the long, painful journey I have been on pursuing #PesaLinkJustice.

Here is the link to the whole #PesalinkTheft ordeal (https://lnkd.in/dWqJVvH4)

The fight drained me financially.
My other innovations have stalled due to a serious liquidity crunch.

I’ve reached a point where silence is no longer an option.

I never thought I’d reach a point of posting this, but I can’t keep quiet anymore.

If anyone can bail me out, support, or connect me to an opportunity, I would be grateful.
Even the hustles I’ve tried on the ground have refused to work.
